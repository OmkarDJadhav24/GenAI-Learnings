LangChain

Defination: 
            Langchain is python's open source framework used for building GenAI applications with LLMs.
            It connects LLMs to:
            1. tools(Google, Python, APIs)
            2. memory (previous chats)
            3. databses (FAISS)
            4. chains (multi-step workflows)

            So instead of you writing everything manually, LangChain handles everything.


Interview Questions + Answers

Q1: What is LangChain and why use it?
A: LangChain is a framework to help connect LLMs with tools like vector DBs, APIs, and memory. It simplifies building GenAI applications like chatbots or data assistants.

Q2: What is a “chain” in LangChain?
A: A chain is a sequence of steps involving LLMs and tools. For example, embedding → retrieval → prompt → LLM → output.
