FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)

Defination:
            FAISS is vector Similarity Search Library developed by Facebook AI. It allows us to store High dimensional embeddings and efficiently search similar vectors using nearest-neighbor techniques.
            It's commonly used in GenAI applications for fast retrieval of document chunks.


Real-World Analogy
üîç Imagine you have 10,000 documents, and someone asks:
‚ÄúWhich 3 are most similar to this question?‚Äù
Instead of checking each document manually, FAISS searches them in milliseconds using smart math.

It‚Äôs like Google Search, but for vectors (numbers representing meanings of text).



 Interview Questions + Answers
Q1: What is FAISS?
A: FAISS is a vector similarity search library that indexes high-dimensional vectors and retrieves the most similar ones quickly.

Q2: How is FAISS used in RAG?
A: FAISS stores document embeddings. When a query is given, it retrieves the most semantically similar documents to help the LLM answer accurately.

Q3: Can FAISS scale to millions of documents? (check in details in future)
A: Yes, FAISS supports indexing millions of embeddings efficiently using techniques like IVF (Inverted File Index) and quantization.
