📘 Understanding Transformers – Complete Guide

🧠 Why Transformers?
Traditional RNNs and LSTMs process sequences step-by-step, making them slow and hard to parallelize. Transformers overcome this by using attention mechanisms to process entire sequences at once, enabling faster training and capturing long-range dependencies.


🔍 High-Level Overview
Transformers consist of:

Encoder-Decoder Architecture

Each Encoder contains: Multi-head Attention + Feed-Forward

Each Decoder contains: Masked Multi-head Attention + Encoder-Decoder Attention + Feed-Forward

Input and output are sequences (sentences, tokens, etc.).



🧩 Core Components
1. Input Embedding
Raw tokens are converted into vectors. Similar words have similar embeddings.

2. Positional Encoding
Since Transformers don’t have recurrence, they add a positional encoding to the input embeddings to give the model information about the order of words.

Example:

Position 0: [0, 0, 0, ...]
Position 1: [0.84, 0.12, ...]


3. Self-Attention Mechanism
For every token, we ask:
Which other tokens should I pay attention to?

💡 Steps:
Create Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) matrices from the input.

Calculate attention scores:
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(Q·Kᵀ / √d_k) · V

Multiply the attention scores by V (Values) to get the weighted output.

This allows the model to dynamically focus on different words depending on the context.



🔁 Encoder Block (×N)
Each encoder block contains:

Multi-Head Self-Attention

Add & Layer Normalization

Feed Forward Neural Network

Add & Layer Normalization

Multiple encoder blocks (usually 6–12) are stacked to learn complex features.




🔁 Decoder Block (×N)
Each decoder block includes:

Masked Multi-Head Attention (to prevent attending to future words)

Encoder-Decoder Attention (focus on encoder output)

Feed Forward Neural Network

Add & Layer Normalization




🔗 Multi-Head Attention
Instead of calculating one attention, we compute multiple in parallel, allowing the model to learn information from different representation subspaces.

Heads = 8 or 12 in most models

Each head has its own Q, K, V matrices



⚙️ Feed-Forward Layer
A simple 2-layer fully connected network:

FFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2



🧮 Positional Encoding Formula
Uses sine and cosine to inject position:

PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))



🏁 Final Output
Decoder generates one token at a time using previously generated tokens + encoder context.

Output passes through a linear + softmax layer to get final predicted token.



⚡ Full Forward Pass Flow:
Input Sentence → Embed → Add Positional Encoding → Encoder Stack → Decoder Stack → Output Tokens



🔄 Training Objective
Usually next word prediction or masked token prediction using cross-entropy loss.
