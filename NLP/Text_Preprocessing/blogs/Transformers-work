Types of language models
In the Transformers library, language models generally fall into three architectural categories:

1.  Encoder-only models (like BERT): These models use a bidirectional approach to understand context from both directions. Theyâ€™re best suited for tasks that require deep understanding of text, such as classification, named entity recognition, and question answering.

2.  Decoder-only models (like GPT, Llama): These models process text from left to right and are particularly good at text generation tasks. They can complete sentences, write essays, or even generate code based on a prompt.

3.  Encoder-decoder models (like T5, BART): These models combine both approaches, using an encoder to understand the input and a decoder to generate output. They excel at sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering.


As we covered in the previous section, language models are typically pretrained on large amounts of text data in a self-supervised manner (without human annotations), then fine-tuned on specific tasks. This approach, known as transfer learning, allows these models to adapt to many different NLP tasks with relatively small amounts of task-specific data.



Understanding which part of the Transformer architecture (encoder, decoder, or both) is best suited for a particular NLP task is key to choosing the right model. Generally, tasks requiring bidirectional context use encoders, tasks generating text use decoders, and tasks converting one sequence to another use encoder-decoders.
